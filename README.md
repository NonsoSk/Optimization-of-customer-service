# Optimization-of-customer-service


## Overview

After successfully completing my excel course on data analysis, I decided to challenge myself with a project to show extensively all that I’ve learnt.
Thus the project is an excel based analysis of the data gotten from a superstore in the United States.
This store seeks to focus more on production of desired goods to her targeted customers; optimizing the most accessible means of shipping; and generally improving her services to her customers.
For the sake of this analysis, we consider this year to be 2017. Thus the dataset is up to date as it contains information from 2014 to this “present” year (2017). 

## Introduction
This is a sales and performance analysis of a superstore. The problems to be addressed by this analysis are:
1)	Determine the category of product that has the highest sales record and show how this product has been sold over the years.
2)	Find out the year it recorded its least performance and trace its profit trend through the months.
3)	Find out the best shipping mode for the company
4)	What is the most demanded product and what category of product is it?
5)	What customer segment contribute more to the total revenue of the company? (To help us know who to channel our products to)
6)	On average, how long does it take products to be delivered from their ordered date?

These are the basic questions that would be addressed by this analysis. However, in the course of the analysis, we shall show different KPIs for proper understanding of this project.
The reason for this project is to have an extensive and comprehensive view of the performance of the company, so as to recommend the best ways and strategies for the optimization of  the services rendered by the company to her customers. 


**I demostrated the following skills in this project**
1) Data Cleaning.
2) Pivot Tables.
3) Pivot Chart.
4) Data Visualization.
5) Critical Thinking.
6) Problem Solving

## Data sourcing
I obtained the data by downloading the csv file from my drive and then imported and converted into an excel file. The data is a sample data of The US superstore.
After the conversion, I cleaned the data, performed my analysis and created visualizations to help answer my questions.

## Data Transformation and cleaning
The US superstore dataset did not really require much cleaning, I checked for spelling error and found none except for local cities or names that weren`t registered in the dictionary. Since they were not errors, I had to ignore it.  I also searched for duplicates, but found none and so after formatting the headers and making my data neat, I proceeded to the next step.


## Analysis and visualization
I analyzed the data step by step according to the question and aim of my analysis. The visuals I created were very easy-to-understand. I used the colors: blue, green, red, Faded-blue, which all meant different things at different points. 
All seven visuals passed different messages all related to the analysis.
Some of the information represented in the visuals are:
- sum total of products over the years
- Total number of ships per shipping mode
- Highest contributing  segment to profit
- Average processing time for each category
